1) Sort the listview by order of descending date. This way the newest note will always be at the top -- could also do by descending id
2) Button to add a new ToDo object must be at the top. Stops user having to scroll through multiple different items in order to add a new one (Bad UI design)
3) Create an onclick listener for the delete button function in the titlePage Adapter class
4) Create a button to save the objects on todoPage (save and return or something)
5) Think of a way to allow a user to edit the object real-time (would using a onTextChanged Listener be inefficient? -- Maybe but would work)
6) Add a check to make sure the ToDoItems are not repeatedly added to Database
7) Add onActivityResult - add the TitleObject passed back to the list associated with listView and update listview
